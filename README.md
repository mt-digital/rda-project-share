# RDA Project Share
## Presented November 17, 2015

You can run the slides yourself after just a few steps:

1. Install node.js: `brew install node` on OS X. If you're on Linux
   you ought to be able to figure it out
2. Use the Node Package Manager (npm) to install dependencies,
including Bower: `npm
install`
3. Install some other dependencies using bower: `bower install`

Node and Bower know what to install because of the files
`package.json` and `bower.json`.

Enjoy!
